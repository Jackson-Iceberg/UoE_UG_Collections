# UoE_UG_Collections
This collection contains all the meaningful undergraduate projects at University of Edinburgh.

#### **UG2 represents year 2 projects including: IADS(Introduction to algorithms and Data structure), Learning, SE(Software Engineering), RA(Reasoning and Agents).** 

##### IADS-Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

To implement and empirically analyses algorithms will be assessed via practical coursework, with an exam to assess other aspects of the course (knowledge and choice of existing algorithms and data structures, theoretical analysis, algorithmic strategies, and applications).

##### Learning

This course provides an introduction to some of the basic mathematical and computational methods for learning from data. We discuss the problems of clustering and classification, and how probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods can be applied to these. Focus: MATLAB

##### SE-Software-Engineering

This project implements a bicycle rental system. The system helps customers to rent the cheapest bicycles and find the nearest bike company to them. The system provides functions such as calculating the rental price, calculating the distance between the customer and the rental company, providing rental renewals, and providing reviews of rental companies.

##### RA-Reasoning and Agents

This course focuses on approaches relating to representation, reasoning and planning for solving real world inference. The course illustrates the importance of (i) using a smart representation of knowledge such that it is conducive to efficient reasoning, and (ii) the need for exploiting task constraints for intelligent search and planning. The notion of representing action, space and time is formalized in the context of agents capable of sensing the environment and taking actions that affect the current state. There is also a strong emphasis on the ability to deal with uncertain data in real world scenarios and hence, the planning and reasoning methods are extended to include inference in probabilistic domains.

#### **UG3 represents year 3 projects including: IAML(Introductory Applied Machine Learning), ILP(Informatics Large Practical), IVR(Introduction to Vision and Robotics), DS(Data Structure).** 

##### IAML-Introductory Applied Machine Learning

The primary aim of the course is to provide the student with a set of practical tools that can be applied to solve real-world problems in machine learning, coupled with an appropriate, principled approach to formulating a solution.

On successful completion of this course, you should be able to: 

1. Explain the scope, goals and limits of machine learning (ML), and the main sub-areas of the field.
2. Describe the various techniques covered in the syllabus and where they fit within the structure of the discipline.
3. Critically compare, contrast and evaluate the different ML techniques in terms of their applicability to different ML problems.
4. Given a data set and problem, use appropriate software to apply these techniques to the data set to solve the problem.
5. Given appropriate data, use a systematic approach to conducting experimental investigations and assessing scientific hypotheses.

##### ILP-Informatics Large Practical

The Informatics Large Practical gives students experience in developing a non-trivial software system and reporting on the end product. In this way, the practical provides an introduction to the issues and requirements of the more demanding fourth-year project. In particular, the student gains practical experience of:

- Reading technical material and identifying the important content
- Identifying and formalising project requirements
- Identifying computational problems and inventing algorithmic solutions
- Constructing a detailed design which does not over-commit to implementation detail
- Implementing and testing a software application which realises the design
- Experimenting with the implementation to explore the solutions to the computational problems
- Writing a report which documents the solutions and the implementation
- Managing a software project using a source-code repository.

-  Image formation, transduction and simple processing; thresholding, filtering and classification methods for extracting object information from an image.
-  Active vision and attention.

-  General approaches and architectures. Classical vs. behaviour-based robotics. Wider issues and implications of robot research.

Learning Outcomes

1. Recall and explain the essential facts, concepts, and principles in robotics and computer vision, demonstrated through written answers in examination conditions.
2. Describe and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of some specific sensor and motor hardware; and some specific software methods for sensory processing and motor control demonstrated through written answers in examination conditions.
3. Employ hardware (e.g. cameras, robots) and software (e.g. OpenCV, ROS) tools to solve a practical problem of sensory-motor control, and will show a working system in a practical class.
4. Identify problem criteria and context, discuss design and development, test, analyse, and evaluate the behaviour of the sensory-motor control system.

##### DS-Data Structure

Data Structure based on Java.

It implemented some classical algorithms, and help better understanding of Data Structures and algorithms.

#### UG4 represents year 4 projects including: Ecclesia (Decentralized_Voting_System), FNLP(Foundations-Of-Natural-Language-Processing), COMN(Computer-Communications-and-Networks), ML(Machine Learning), PSP(Python Scrapy Project), ST(Software Testing)

##### FNLP-Foundations-Of-Natural-Language-Processing

Course Outline

This course covers some of the linguistic and algorithmic foundations of natural language processing (NLP). It builds on algorithmic and data science concepts developed in second year courses, applying these to NLP problems. It also equips students for more advanced NLP courses in year 4. The course is strongly empirical, using corpus data to illustrate both core linguistic concepts and algorithms, including language modelling, part of speech tagging, syntactic processing, the syntax-semantics interface, and aspects of semantic and pragmatic processing. The theoretical study of linguistic concepts and the application of algorithms to corpora in the empirical analysis of those concepts will be interleaved throughout the course.

Learning Outcomes

1. Given an appropriate NLP problem, students should be able to select a corpus and an annotation scheme for the problem and justify the choice over other candidates.
2. Students should also be able to identify suitable evaluation measures for the problem and provide a written explanation of the role of annotated corpora in natural language processing.
3. Given one of the main linguistic issues relevant to NLP (including the representation and induction of syntactic knowledge, and the modelling of lexical and semantic information, and the syntax-semantics interface), students should be able to construct an example of the issue and provide an explanation of how their example illustrates the issue in general.
4. Given an example of one of the main linguistic issues identified above, students should be able to classify it as belonging to that issue and relate the example to the issue in general.
5. Given an NLP problem, students should be able to analyse, assess and justify which algorithms are most appropriate for solving the problem, based on an understanding of fundamental algorithms such as Viterbi algorithm, inside-outside, chart-based parsing and generation.

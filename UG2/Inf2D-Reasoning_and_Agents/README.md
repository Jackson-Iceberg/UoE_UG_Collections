# Inf2D-cw1 Reasoning and Agents
Informatics 2D (Coursework 1):Search and Games

### Course Outline

This course focuses on approaches relating to representation, reasoning and planning for solving real world inference. The course illustrates the importance of (i) using a smart representation of knowledge such that it is conducive to efficient reasoning, and (ii) the need for exploiting task constraints for intelligent search and planning. The notion of representing action, space and time is formalized in the context of agents capable of sensing the environment and taking actions that affect the current state. There is also a strong emphasis on the ability to deal with uncertain data in real world scenarios and hence, the planning and reasoning methods are extended to include inference in probabilistic domains.

### Learning Outcomes

On completion of the course, you will be able to: 

1. Use task constraints to make search efficient
2. Perform Inference with First Order Logic and appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of this and other logic representations (eg Propositional)
3. Use STRIPS to plan and execute actions using either Propositional or First Order Logic representation
4. Create a Bayesian net representation of a non-deterministic planning problem
5. Create a basic probabilistic action agent using simulated state transitions and goals.

# Computer-Communications-and-Networks
Courseworks at the University of Edinburgh,UG4

### Course Outline

**Syllabus** wise, we will cover the following topics in this course:

- Introduction to Computer Networks, the Internet, TCP/IP architecture and protocols

  - Key networking concepts: protocol, network architecture, reference models, layering, service, interface, multiplexing, switching and standards
  - Network performance metrics
  - Physical layer overview

- Application Layer

  - Representative Internet applications (Web/HTTP, P2P, multimedia, etc.)
  - Developing network applications using socket API

- Transport Layer

  - Connectionless vs. connection-oriented communications
  - Reliable data transfer
  - Congestion/flow/error control
  - UDP and TCP protocols

- Network Layer

  - Control and data planes: routing vs. forwarding
  - IP protocol and addressing
  - Routing algorithms
  - Software-defined networking (SDN) â€“ control plane, generalized forwarding, OpenFlow API and protocol
  - Router internals

- Link Layer and Local Area Networks (LANs)

  - Link layer services and implementation

  - Error detection and correction

  - Channel allocation and multiple access protocols

  - Ethernet and switched LANs

    

- **Wireless and Mobile Networks (time permitting)**



##### Learning Outcomes

1. Explain key networking concepts, principles, design issues and techniques at all protocol layers.
2. Contrast between different types of networks (e.g., wide area networks vs. local area networks, wired vs. wireless) in terms of their characteristics and protocols used.
3. Describe different types of networked applications and what underlying network protocols are needed to meet their diverse requirements.
4. Distinguish between control and data planes in computer networks, and their corresponding architectures in real-world networks (including the Internet).
5. Understand reliable transport protocols and networked system architectures via implementation using Socket APIs, measurement and analysis.

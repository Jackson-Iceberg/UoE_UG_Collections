The 5 neighbours solution is a more 'complex model' (why?) and the mean class accuracy seems to be worse. The choice of model will depend on your goals. If you don't care about predicting `IE` correctly, the `1000` neighbour model gives greater overall accuracy and is a simpler model - therefore one would prefer to err towards using it.

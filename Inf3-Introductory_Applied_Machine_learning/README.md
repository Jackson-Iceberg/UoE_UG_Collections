# Introductory Applied Machine Learning-IAML

### Course Outline

The primary aim of the course is to provide the student with a set of practical tools that can be applied to solve real-world problems in machine learning, coupled with an appropriate, principled approach to formulating a solution.

Organisations seek to make better decisions by examining their data with an aim to discovering and/or drawing conclusions about the information contained within. This course is about the principled application of machine learning techniques to extracting information from data. The main area that will be discussed is supervised learning, which is concerned with learning to predict an output, given inputs. A second area of study is unsupervised learning, where we wish to discover the structure in a set of patterns, i.e. there is no output "teacher signal".

We will cover the following topics: Introduction to Data and Models, Memory based methods, Decision Trees, Error functions, Minimising Error. Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Margin Based Methods, Perceptron, Support Vector Machines, Na√Øve Bayes, Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, K-means, Simple Gaussian Mixture Models, Hierarchical Clustering and Evaluation of performance.



### Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this course, you should be able to: 

1. Explain the scope, goals and limits of machine learning (ML), and the main sub-areas of the field.
2. Describe the various techniques covered in the syllabus and where they fit within the structure of the discipline.
3. Critically compare, contrast and evaluate the different ML techniques in terms of their applicability to different ML problems.
4. Given a data set and problem, use appropriate software to apply these techniques to the data set to solve the problem.
5. Given appropriate data, use a systematic approach to conducting experimental investigations and assessing scientific hypotheses.

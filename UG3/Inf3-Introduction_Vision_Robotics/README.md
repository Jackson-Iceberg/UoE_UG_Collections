# Introduction to Vision and Robotics-IVR

### Course Outline

The issues addressed will include the following:

-  Applications of robotics and vision; the nature of the problems to be solved; historical overview and current state of the art.
-  Robot actuators and sensors. Parallels to biological systems.
-  Robot control: Open-loop, feed-forward and feedback; PID (proportional integral differential) control.
-  Image formation, transduction and simple processing; thresholding, filtering and classification methods for extracting object information from an image.
-  Active vision and attention.
-  Sensors for self monitoring.
-  General approaches and architectures. Classical vs. behaviour-based robotics. Wider issues and implications of robot research.

##### Learning Outcomes

1. Recall and explain the essential facts, concepts, and principles in robotics and computer vision, demonstrated through written answers in examination conditions.
2. Describe and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of some specific sensor and motor hardware; and some specific software methods for sensory processing and motor control demonstrated through written answers in examination conditions.
3. Employ hardware (e.g. cameras, robots) and software (e.g. OpenCV, ROS) tools to solve a practical problem of sensory-motor control, and will show a working system in a practical class.
4. Identify problem criteria and context, discuss design and development, test, analyse, and evaluate the behaviour of the sensory-motor control system.

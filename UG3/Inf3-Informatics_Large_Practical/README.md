#### Informatics Large Practical 

##### ILP-CW-Drone Flight Path (Dynamic Programming)

1. Formulated the map of best flight path with Gjson
2. Found the best flight path based on the positions of drone and air detection points, to ensure that all the detection points are visited and return to starting point in the shortest number of steps.
3. Formulated a drone route map via Gjson and used algorithm: A* algorithm, greedy algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, Ant colony optimization algorithm.
4. Succeed in that all the drones could read all the air detections points and return back to the starting point before the power exhausted, increasing the drone efficiency by 25%.

### Course Outline

The Informatics Large Practical gives students experience in developing a non-trivial software system and reporting on the end product. In this way, the practical provides an introduction to the issues and requirements of the more demanding fourth-year project. In particular, the student gains practical experience of:

- Reading technical material and identifying the important content
- Identifying and formalising project requirements
- Identifying computational problems and inventing algorithmic solutions
- Constructing a detailed design which does not over-commit to implementation detail
- Implementing and testing a software application which realises the design
- Experimenting with the implementation to explore the solutions to the computational problems
- Writing a report which documents the solutions and the implementation
- Managing a software project using a source-code repository.

**Learning Outcomes**

1. Consider alternative algorithm designs and data structures for tackling a given problem.
2. Show awareness of the difference between design and implementation in software development.
3. Implement and debug a software system of medium to large size.
4. Design and carry out experiments and tests, and explain the methodology involved.
5. Write a well-structured report providing clear and concise documentation for a software project.

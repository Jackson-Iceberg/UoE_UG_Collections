# Inf2B-Learning-coursework

Coursework name: Informatics 2B - Learning

This course provides an introduction to some of the basic mathematical and computational methods for learning from data. We discuss the problems of clustering and classification, and how probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods can be applied to these.

Focus: MATLAB

### Learning Outcomes

1. Manipulate and describe multidimensional data using summary statistics.
2. Define and use methods such as Na√Øve Bayes, Gaussians, and single-layer networks to model and classify multidimensional data.
3. Describe and apply nearest-neighbour and clustering approaches and the concept of discrimi-nant functions.
